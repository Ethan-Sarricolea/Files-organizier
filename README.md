# Files organizier

## Description

By using the executable you could organize the files in a directory into different folders according to their extension.

## Install

Run the next command in terminal:
+ `git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Sarricolea/Files-organizier.git`

## Use 

1. Open terminal in cloned repository or move to directory in terminal whit the next command
    + `cd Files-organizier/bin`


2. Run the executable file:
    + `sorting.exe "path"`

    #### Note:
        The path must be enclosed in single or double quotes for the code to function correctly.
        It is possible that an error message is generated when organizing even though there are no problems.

If you have python in compiler in your device, you can execute a window to run the dart file with the next command:

+ `python capy_organizier\sort.py`

###### **The dart files were created in a Dart course with the guidance and help of engineer Alejando Leyva, whose page I share: https://www.alejandro-leyva.com**
