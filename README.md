# File Organizer

## Description

Using the executable you can organize the files in a directory into different folders based on their extension.

## Download

Type the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Sarricolea/Files-organizier.git
```

If you don't have git downloaded or this option doesn't work you can download the compressed folder in a zip file

## Usage

1. Open the terminal in the cloned repository or navigate to the directory in the terminal with the following command:

```bash
cd File Organizer\bin
```

2. Launch the executable with the following command:
+ cmd: 
```bash
sorting.exe "path"
```
+ PowerShell: 
```bash
.\sorting.exe "path"
```

##### Note:
The path must be placed in double or single quotes for proper operation.
It is possible that when organizing an error message is generated even though there are no problems.

#### Extra

If you have the python compiler on your device you can run the python window to start the dart file with the following command:

```bash
Python capy_organizier\sort.py
```
#### Note
It is possible that an error will appear when organizing directories, I am still working on it.
